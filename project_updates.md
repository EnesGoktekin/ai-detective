- **Multilingual Chat:** AI will support multiple languages in chat
- **Message Queue:** Only last 5 user & AI messages sent to AI (+ summary)
- **Summary Frequency:** Every 5 user messages trigger a new summary (overwrites previous)
- **Database Architecture:** Separates Static Case Data from Dynamic Game State
- **AI Context Management:** Uses current_summary field + last 5 messages
