## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Dependencies

### Technical Risks

1. **AI Response Quality**
   - **Risk:** Gemini AI may generate inconsistent or off-character responses
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive prompt engineering and testing required
   - **Impact:** High - Core gameplay depends on AI quality

2. **AI Context Management**
   - **Risk:** Summary mechanism may lose critical conversation details
   - **Mitigation:** Careful tuning of summary frequency and content
   - **Impact:** Medium - May affect game continuity

3. **Evidence Detection Logic**
   - **Risk:** AI may not reliably detect when evidence should be unlocked
   - **Mitigation:** Implement keyword-based fallback system
   - **Impact:** High - Critical for game progression

4. **Database Performance**
   - **Risk:** Chat history storage may grow rapidly
   - **Mitigation:** Implement data archiving and cleanup strategies
   - **Impact:** Medium - Affects scalability

5. **API Rate Limits**
   - **Risk:** Gemini API rate limits may restrict gameplay
   - **Mitigation:** Implement request queuing and user cooldown (already planned)
   - **Impact:** Medium - May affect user experience during peak usage

6. **State Synchronization**
   - **Risk:** Frontend and backend game state may become desynchronized
   - **Mitigation:** Implement robust state management and validation
   - **Impact:** High - Could break save/resume functionality

### Project Dependencies

#### External Services
1. **Supabase**
   - Free tier limitations
   - Network connectivity required
   - Potential service outages

2. **Gemini 2.5 Flash API**
   - API key management
   - Quota and rate limits
   - API changes/deprecation
   - Cost scaling with users

3. **Vercel**
   - Deployment limits on free tier
   - Serverless function timeout limits
   - Build time restrictions

#### Technical Stack Dependencies
1. **Node.js** (Backend runtime)
2. **React** (Frontend framework)
3. **Vite** (Build tool)
4. **TypeScript** (Type safety)

#### Development Dependencies
1. **Git/GitHub** for version control
2. **npm/yarn** for package management
3. **Development environment** setup

### Resource Dependencies

1. **Content Creation**
   - **Dependency:** 5 complete cases with stories, suspects, evidence, solutions
   - **Impact:** High - No game without content
   - **Time Estimate:** Significant - each case requires careful design

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - **Dependency:** Well-crafted system instructions for Chat AI
   - **Impact:** Critical - Determines game feel and quality
   - **Time Estimate:** Iterative process requiring testing

3. **UI/UX Design**
   - **Dependency:** Dark/mysterious theme with yellow/gold accents
   - **Impact:** Medium - Affects user immersion
   - **Time Estimate:** Design work before implementation

### Development Workflow Dependencies

1. **Testing Environment**
   - Local development setup required
   - Test database instance needed
   - API keys for testing

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Each step depends on previous steps
   - Testing between steps mandatory
   - Git workflow (commit/push after testing)

## üìù Notes

- **MVP Focus:** The current plan emphasizes MVP functionality
- **AI Access:** For MVP, AI has access to all data (including solutions)
- **Future Enhancement:** Truth-blind AI system planned for post-MVP
- **Monolingual UI:** MVP will have single language UI
- **Multilingual Chat:** AI will support multiple languages in chat
- **Message Queue:** Only last 5 user & AI messages sent to AI (+ summary)
- **Summary Frequency:** Every 5 user messages trigger a new summary
