## 🐛 Bugs Fixed Today (October 25, 2025)

### 1. Chat Endpoint Route Mismatch ✅
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Chat completely broken  
**Commit:** 7aa8196

**Problem:**
- Frontend: `/api/chat/{game_id}/chat`
- Backend: `/api/games/{game_id}/chat`
- Result: 404 Not Found on all messages

**Solution:**
- Updated `server.ts`: `app.use('/api/games', chatRouter)`
- Updated `GamePage.tsx`: Correct API endpoint
- Updated `api.ts`: Documentation fix

**Test Result:** ✅ Messages send successfully

---

### 2. Evidence Stats Parsing Error ✅
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** "Required: 0" showing instead of actual count  
**Commit:** e73734c

**Problem:**
- Frontend expected: `statsData.required_evidence`
- Backend returned: `statsData.stats.required_count`
- Additional fields missing: `required_unlocked`, `can_make_accusation`

**Solution:**
- Parse nested `stats` object correctly
- Added `requiredUnlocked` and `canAccuse` to state
- Use backend's `can_make_accusation` instead of `unlocked >= required` logic
- Display format: "Required: 3 (2/3 unlocked)"

**Test Result:** ✅ Stats display correctly, "Ready to accuse" works

---

### 3. Evidence List Not Displaying ✅
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Evidence cards never appear despite unlocking  
**Commit:** a19eb0d

**Problem:**
- Frontend expected: `evidenceData.evidence`
- Backend returned: `evidenceData.unlocked_evidence`
- Nested structure: `evidence_lookup.display_name` vs flat `name`

**Solution:**
- Transform backend response to frontend interface:
  ```typescript
  const newEvidence = (evidenceData.unlocked_evidence || []).map((item: any) => ({
    evidence_id: item.evidence_id,
    name: item.evidence_lookup?.display_name,
    description: item.evidence_lookup?.description,
    significance: item.evidence_lookup?.is_required_for_accusation ? 'Required' : 'Optional',
    unlocked_at: item.unlocked_at,
  }));
  ```

**Test Result:** ✅ Evidence cards display correctly with details

---

### 4. Progressive Evidence Discovery ✅
**Severity:** Major (Gameplay)  
**Impact:** AI spoiling all evidence locations upfront  
**Commits:** 5a37cdc, 6a4d34a

**Problem:**
- AI was told ALL evidence details at start
- Response: "Masada mendil var, yatakta saat var..." (instant spoilers)
- No investigation mystery

**Solution - LOCKED/UNLOCKED System:**

1. **AI sees ALL evidence with status markers:**
   ```
   [LOCKED] Evidence at desk - Not yet examined
   [LOCKED] Evidence at bedside - Not yet examined
   [UNLOCKED] Lace Handkerchief: silk handkerchief with L (at desk)
   ```

2. **Investigation flow:**
   - User: "Çevrede ne var?" → AI: Lists scene objects (desk, bed, table) - NO spoilers
   - User: "Masaya bak" → AI: Checks evidence list
     - If [LOCKED] at desk: Describe naturally using keywords
     - "Masada dantel bir mendil var, ipek gibi..." (keywords trigger unlock)
   - Evidence unlocks → Status: [LOCKED] → [UNLOCKED]
   - Next message: AI can reference full details

3. **Technical implementation:**
   - Modified `buildSystemInstruction()` to accept `unlockedEvidence` param
   - Chat route fetches unlocked evidence WITH details
   - Map evidence with status: `isUnlocked ? [UNLOCKED] full : [LOCKED] hint`
   - Updated `knowledge_boundary` rules for progressive investigation

**Test Result:** ✅ AI guides naturally, no spoilers, mystery preserved
